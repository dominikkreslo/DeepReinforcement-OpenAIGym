# DeepReinforcement-OpenAIGym

These files and examples were used to help myself learn about the way that AI, Machine Learning,and Deep Reinforcement Learning worked in a class of mine. "cartpole_EC.py" is the final project that I worked on, which used the OpenAiGym library to pull an Atari game, and use ML to teach it to win that particular game. 
Testing was done through Google Collab Notebooks.
